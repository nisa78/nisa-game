# A Pygame by Nisa Phelps
## Background
This project is not yet complete, and was started prior to taking USF's Object-Oriented Software Design course. My plan was to get a head start on the course by implementing a few minor object-oriented concepts in a way that would be both visual and fun. Although the code is very unorganized and messy, it did help me conceptualize the ideas taught in that course, leading to a grade of over 100% in the course.

The code within the repository is not representative of my skills as they stand currently and was initially created prior to Spring 2020 as a personal project. Due to working multiple jobs once the Spring 2020 semester began, the project was halted and will hopefully be picked up again in a less hectic time.

## Tools Used
 - Python 3.8.5
 - Pygame 2.0.1

## Goals for the Future
 - Reorganize code
 - Improve documentation
 - Create a plan prior to moving forward
 - Design a start menu
 - Add healthbar
 - Add scoreboard
 - Add 3 more playable sprites
 - Add obstacles
 - Learn more about networking by first learning how to set the game up with a LAN
 - Add power-ups and enemies if necessary
